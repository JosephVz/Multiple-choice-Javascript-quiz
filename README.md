# <Multiple-Choice-JavaScript-Quiz>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

    My motivation to make this project was to see what could be built from scratch, i was able to sloppily put together a working website with an interactable quiz, however getting much more than that will be difficult.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    I built this project to test the current knowledge of my skills, im able to get a quiz working but editing existing code and adding onto it is very tricky. This asignment can also be applied to future projects as well

- What problem does it solve?

    This project helps me solve the problem of understanding how to build an interactable website. This allows me to use this knowledge in the future and apply this to projects going forward.

- What did you learn?

    In this assignment i learned a lot about how functions work and the basics of JavaScript. However what i believe is even more important is that i learned how much i really don't know about JavaScript. This assignment helped me understand where my knowledge really is on the subject.
